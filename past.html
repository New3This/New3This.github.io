        <div class="s HSC">
            <h3 class="topic-name">HSC</h3>
            <p class="Htext">The school I attended at had compacted-cirriculumn, 
                meaning I would have to do my HSC throughout 2 years. 
                This mean that the total subjects I had to do were split in half, 
                where one year I would do one-half and the next year, the other half.  
                <br><br>It had it's pros and cons but I think a major convinence is that you 
                wouldn't need to remember as much content when doing the exams, 
                since I was being examined for half my total subjects.<br><br>
            
                The following subjects I completed surprisingly don't include much tech-related content, and that's cause I 
                had not planned to do computing science until later:

                <ul id="list">
                    <li>English Advanced</li>
                    <li>Maths Advanced</li>
                    <li>Biology</li>
                    <li>Chemistry</li>
                    <li>Physics</li>
                    <li>Maths Extension 1</li>
                    <li>Burger Preparing lvl 3</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="pen.png" alt="pen" id="pen">

                <p class="Htext">So yeah that is how it basically went with HSC. 
                Being in my current position though, I probably would have chosen IT or something
                more relevant. <br><br><br>
                Oh and some cons of this compacted-cirriculumn would be that you get half as much time 
                to study for your subjects (though you're only studying for half your subjects) so yeah.
                <br><br>You get thrown earlier at a time when you may not understand its seriousness, tho I think that con didn't 
                affect me..just putting it out there to fill this page.</p><br><br>

                </p>
        </div>
        <div class="s Work">
            <h3>Work Experience</h3><br>
            <p class="Htext">I don't have any work experience apart from the activity I did in high school where you would get job experience kinda? You don't get paid or anything, just do the task there and yeah, that happened for a week.
                Other than that nothing. <br><br>I did get quote on quote hired from McDonalds or so I was told during the interview, though as days went by I heard nothing..
                <br><br>
                Also, I did become a student council volunteer and one of the school leaders...but that wasn't much of a feat. Requirement: interest. 
                <br><br>
                And so there isn't much to talk about when it comes to computer experience. The I do have some programming experience from my bachelor of Computing Science, which is cool. Managed to build a CLI-based game and a GUI one: snake game.<br>
