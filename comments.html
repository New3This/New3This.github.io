                        <p class="saas">The overall design consists of three important factors: Accessibility, Aesthetics and Structure. 
                            More specifically, the use selectors such as class and divs allowed for better element control, in regards to styling and positioning. This allowed for an structure capable of adapting to a variety of devices modes (later discussed).<br><br>The integration of divs, classes, spans and other elements enabled CSS to properly integrate customability. For example, everything in this page is built from the barebones of these elements, ultimately being pieced in a way to construct something like colored tables, changing colored backgrounds and everything else displayed.
                        
                        Specifically, the header and body element were the most important to structure, with header comprising of a navigation bar, and body comprising of borders, tables, titles, paragraphs all further explored below</p>

                    <p class="titlemann">Aesthetics</p><br>

                    <p class="aesmsg">For the UI design of the website, I wanted to experiment a bit with what I could do with CSS, meaning I took an experimental approach in the intention of creating a sense of abstract feel. With this assessment being an introduction to myself and what my skills looked like, I thought that of including stuff like animations to reinforce this aesthetic form of abstraction, whilst focusing on accessibility. For example, in the first page I wanted to try create a dark mode page where reading was easier on, though in later pagers I tried colour-changing backgrounds, that comprised of contrasting colours for better reading.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="aesmsg">A potential issue of background colours is its readability and so I created a highlighting tool which would highlight the text upon hovering over it OR if on mobile, tapping it.</p>

                    <p class="titleman">Background and its Colours</p><br>

                    <p class="aesmsg">Sometimes the backgrounds would consist of colours, and this was to establish an dark mode aesthetic. I also included looped animations/gifs that would further reinforce the inital dark mode feel established.Though upon reaching this webpage, it changed into a space of changing colours. <br><br>For the background, I generally used a variety of blue shades. The purpose of this colour is its impact on sensory responses, and to sum this <a class="thethe" href="https://www.disabledliving.co.uk/blog/colours-vs-people-with-special-needs/">site's research</a> using a quote, I would say, blue is the <span class="quote">"preferred colour for those with a visual impairment."</span> 
                    Though the shades of blue vary in effectiveness for a variety of people, hence why I implemented a range of blue shades, especially in the <a href="Future.html">Future Page</a>.</p>

                    <p class="aesmsg">An example of border-use is shown below, and the intended purpose of this design form is to provide a smooth transition between different colours, or to frame an idea. This generally requires
                    a judicious selection of colours to create the transition, whilst appealing to my accessibility goal of using colour contrast. Kinda sounds contradictory when using colours that provide a smooth transition whilst also creating contrast, and it does initalliy. However, to 
                    fix this design flaw I used animations for this purpose, which allowed for the use of a multitude of colours, where each colour could fufil the goal of creating contrast between colours or a smooth transition.<br><br></p>
                    
                    
                    <p class="titleman">Header + Navigation Bar</p><br>
                    <p class="aesmsg">For the header I wanted it to be transparent, so that the background would fill its look, to create somewhat of a seemless merge of display. This allowed for every background change to also affect the header appearence, which is why
                    you see a variety of backgrounds also behind the nav bar. This helped reinforce this abstract look established from each page.
                    I also made it so that 
                    if your cursor is on the nav bar page options, it would show a RGB-ish rainbow to highlight the fact that it's being clicked on. 
                    To reinforce the authenticity of the nav bar, I also changed the color of the page we were on and removed the option to select that page again.
