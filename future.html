        <div class="spacee"></div>
        <p class="wallpara">Before I graduate, I'd like to have done an internship..perhaps specialising in software engineering?
        More specifically as a full stack engineer. Though the very least I would have liked to know how to use react, node and other computer programs 
        that is most-likely to be necessary for current jobs.</p>

        <h3 class="h33">From after graduation</h3>        <div class="spacee"></div>

        <p class="wallpara">By now I would like to be doing a second internship or at least an internship. 
        I'll probably have finalised my thoughts on what I'd like to specialise in, and maybe what company.</p>
        <div class="spacee"></div>

        <p class="wallpara">Also hoping I've developed a resume with a diversity of projects using different skills and programming languages.
        Don't have any current thoughts on what to do to prepare for that, though it'll probably be in the focus on data structures and algorithms.
        Hopefully I can throw some internship experience onto the resume alongside all that.</p>

        <h3 class="h33">Electives/Subjects</h3>        <div class="spacee"></div>

        <p class="wallpara">Not entirely sure as to what electives I want to do, though I plan on majoring in enterprise systems development.
        Seems the most related to software engineering..I think. Though cybersecurity was a close second, though I thought that I may need to do a masters
        to reach an industry level of experience. </p>
